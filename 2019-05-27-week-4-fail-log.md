# Week 4 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

## Activities for this week:  
- Regular expressions  
This was a cool exercise to do! I've had experience in regular expressions from school and work since its a very handy way of getting specific data or selecting certain things. I think its interesting in the context of extracting formal data and information vs what the exercises done in the computer science classes that deal with arbitrary scenarios.  
Some good to know regular expressions that I didn't know of:  
- \< and \b is beginning of word (always thought it was ^)  
- \> and \b is end of word (always thought it was $)  


- Refine
