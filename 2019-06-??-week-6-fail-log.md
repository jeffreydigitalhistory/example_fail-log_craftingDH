# Week 6 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

## Activities for this week:  
- Create website  
I partially set up my website previously and am familiar with Jekyll and some of the formatting for it so this part was pretty easy for myself. That being said, it was cool to learn about the built in themes!  
- Capstone exercise
