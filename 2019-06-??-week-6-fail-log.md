# Week 6 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

## Activities for this week:  
- Create website  
I partially set up my website previously and am familiar with Jekyll and some of the formatting for it so this part was pretty easy for myself. That being said, it was cool to learn about the built in themes!  
- Capstone exercise  
I alluded to alot of the problems in the blog, particularly my issues with contemplating different ideas for how to approach the Candian War Diaries dataset and starting my own project. I struggled quite a bit on that and just opted for the extension of the residential school project since it was a topic that I was actually quite interested in and thought there might be different ways to try and approach the subject.  

## Comments/Concerns
Overall, the intial struggle was real which is why I was a bit pressed for time overall to finish the project and just had to run with conclusions that I got but overall I enjoyed the activity itself, even though I think I could have probably done other cools things with more effort and time on my end.
