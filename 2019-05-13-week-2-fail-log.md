# Week 2 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

## Activities for this week:
Writing in Markdown,
Using the DH Box command line,
Converting files with the command line,
Setting up GitHub,
Interacting with GitHub from the command line,


Markdown:
I found Markdown to be very useful and interesting to learn! Coming from a Computer Science background, it reminds me of other markup languages such as HTML that has its own format for things. Overall, I didn't have too much trouble trying to figure things out and use it


DHBox Command Line:
This was all fairly straightforward for me - I'm quite familiar with Linux commands but did find the Pandoc conversion tool to be a pretty cool things that I didnt know of before.
*Useful commands from this exercise:*
Installing pandoc: 
- wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb
- sudo dpkg -i pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb
Basic writing:
- history > dhbox-work-today.md
Conversion:
- pandoc -o todayscommands.docx dhbox-work-today.md (replace docx with html, etc)


Github:
Also another refresher but it was interesting finding new commands!
git add -A (usually just do .)
git branch -va (checking what branches are available)
(Always forget the following when setting up new repos)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NEW-REPO.git
git push -u origin master


## Comments/Concerns

Overall was a good module! The exercises were well explained and showed a step by step process to go through the material. I was able to learn a couple new things here and there that I will definitely try to take into account the new time I do more work!
