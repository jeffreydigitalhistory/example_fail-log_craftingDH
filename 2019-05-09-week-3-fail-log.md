# Week 3 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

Activities for this week:  
- The Dream Case  
- Wget  
- Writing a program to extract data from a webpage  
- Encoding transcribed text  
- Collecting data from Twitter  
- Coverting images to text with Tesseract  

The Dream Case was pretty straightforward - just using nano to log what was searched in the dbs and saved into Github

Wget was interesting and had a bunch of useful options that I didn't know of!  
Recording some here for future reference:  
wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/  
wget -m -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca  

I liked that we also did a bit of Python scripting - I won't include it since it seems to be specific to this module

Encoding the transcription was definitely something new I've never done before and made me really dive into the content and check for specific people, places and arguments that could be important.
