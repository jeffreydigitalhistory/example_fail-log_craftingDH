# Week 5 fail log

(Note: This is a scratch pad; record of commands, code written, memos to self of websites gone for help etc)

## Activities for this week:  
For the two exercises done (that I might be basing my capstone exercise on), I will be doing it on the Topic Modelling Tool and Text Analysis with Overview  


### Topic Modelling Tool:  
- My first impressions were good but I initially was struggling with launching it; my fault though since I didn't read the cliffnotes of not to git clone it and try it that way
- Fortunately, the instructions themselves were straightforward
- The output of the tool is really cool! I actually was able to make sense of this since I just took a more technical course on intelligent systems and topic modelling was one of the things we covered
- I'm impressed with it's simplicity and the way you can navigate to the different topics through the output html since they are clickable links
- I'm curious about how it would have functioned with other kinds of datasets, the one I used was the CND.csv that was provided by the prof. The current topics have a large subset of words that don't necessarily draw any sort of usable data from which I can see. For example, the highest rated topic was this: "united mr country scotland kingdom great inform states land government state general south number good place house colony 2 present". I suppose you can see that it is talking about the land and government; an overall picture of the sentiment towards them.
- The ease and potential usefulness of the tool make convince me to use it for the capstone exercise!  

### Text Analysis with Overview  
- A little upset that I had to create an account but thats the price for using a free tool!  
- For what it's worth, incredibly easy to set up as well (just upload the file and it does all the analysis for you)
- I've only scraped what I found in the documents but there is a lot of good and useful things to play around with (the search seems to be so good if you have a specific subset of documents to look through)
- What's a good sign is that the word cloud is similar to the pieces of text picked out in the topic modelling tool; reaffirming the validity of both tools

## Comments/Concerns
I've found this particular module to be very interesting with it's coverage into a broad span of topics such as corpus linguistics and text analysis as well as visualization tools and thoughts on it. The two tools I looked at seem to be very powerful and I hope that I can find a way to use them in my capstone exercise!
