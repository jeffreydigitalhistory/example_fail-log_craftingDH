*Questions*  
Have you ever sat down with one of the librarians to get help finding something?  

Consider the knowledge and labour involved not just with finding materials, but in making materials findable in the first place. Make an entry in your blog that reflects on these questions in the light of your annotations.

The article I chose to talk about is [Seams and edges: Dreams of aggregation access discovery in a broken world](http://discontents.com.au/seams-and-edges-dreams-of-aggregation-access-discovery-in-a-broken-world/).

In regards to the questions, I don't think I ever explicitly sat down with a librarian for finding books at any point in my life. In elementary and early high school life, I already looked upon libraries as old vestigial remnants of physical data archives since I was introduced into technology and, frankly, spoiled by Google. Therefore, I regarded a lot of librarians as keepers/overseerers of the institution rather than a source of knowing where things are, since they also did not always know where to find things and I didn't blame them. In large libraries, it's almost impossible to expect an individual to know where things belong and if they were currently checked out or not which is why the library catalogue exists. In the odd case I didn't know what to look for, there were usually self library catalogues kiosks that would tell me if books were checked out or not, which in a sense, functioned as the real "librarians". I dont mean to disparage librarians and their function but there is an increasing, if not already established, need to move to digital forms of keeping track of assets so that it can be properly and efficiently. 

To try and convey my respect to librarians a bit mroe, with respect to the second statement and question, the librarians ensure that everything gets put into the proper place from a physical point of view: primarily by managing the systems that keep track of the information and putting data entities into their respective locations. In the context of a well functioning library, staying on top of materials and putting them back into place is an important piece of the puzzle and ultimately makes finding materials easily (can almost be the "indexing" equivalent of search engines). Without a proper indexing and traversing backend, a search engine will fall flat.

Now, with respect to the above metaphors, I think a segway into Google is in place as that was the focus of my annotations. I thought it was relevant to this topic when considering searchability and our [reliance](https://hyp.is/keaGRnwIEemZCz_Kt_3dJQ/discontents.com.au/seams-and-edges-dreams-of-aggregation-access-discovery-in-a-broken-world/) on it. Unless it's a proprietary book of some sort, you can almost ubiquitously find whatever you want on Google: tutorials, history, images, people, etc. This is all fueled by a top notch search algorithms and indexing methodologies but I also like the take the article took on how the data is displayed. The somewhat [flat, minimalistic](https://hyp.is/ClagZnwJEemDt9t-Jr7bfw/discontents.com.au/seams-and-edges-dreams-of-aggregation-access-discovery-in-a-broken-world/) can be a limiting aspect to how we can ultimately consume the information and make connections - it functions on one level but can't it be done in more dimensions to stimulate other ways of thinking and interpreting the data? 

In either case, the amount of work and effort to do this manually is staggering and even from Google's digital point of view, they have invested millions and will continue to do so as the methods to make search even more powerful become increasingly complex and sophisticated.
