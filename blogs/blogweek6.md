# Week 6 Reflections:


## Activities for this week:  
- Set up website  
I actually set up part of the website earlier in the course since I thought that was where we were initially supposed to be hosting all of our blogs on. Therefore, for Option 1, I was already at least halfway through. Interestingly enough, I didn't know there were built in themes so it was cool to be able to learn about that and potentially use it for my other github account.  
- Capstone exercise
What I decided to work on for the Capstone exercise is Option Two - extending an existing work of digital history. I picked Ryan Pickering's OK Google: Residential Schools because it seems like an interesting topic to discuss and think about.
