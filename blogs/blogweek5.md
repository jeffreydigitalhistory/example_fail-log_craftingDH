# Week 5 Reflections:

## Reflection on readings: 

Questions to reflect on:  
What would your last essay last term have looked like, if you'd been thinking along these lines?  
- The last history class/term I took was ancient civilization and it was a lot of reading and quizzing rather than essays. However, if I were to apply this situation to something where I did need data, I would think that it would make things much much simplier and easy to draw conclusions. The best thing would be that it is also solid evidence of how the data is interpretted in terms of visualization, in terms of retrieval and making sense of it all.  
What could history be like if more of our materials went through these mills?  
- History would be more quantative and analysis based rather than conjecture. That being said, as one of the articles pointed out, the data retrieved and analyzed by these methods and tools aren't perfect; they just make it easier and help us see things through another lens. It would definitely be a shift in how things are done and gathered and I think overall a good thing if the tools are further refined and the information gotten from them is not the end all conclusions.  
Ask yourself: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this? Make an entry in your blog on this theme.  
- I think in general everyone would benefit from this as long as they do not take it at face value all thge time. Corpus linguistics that are able to find patterns and deal with a much larger volume of information and analysis than people can handle. The people who could be hurt from this is us; as it is already prevalent in the internet, there is fake data and information everywhere and that could hurt us who might take the information for what it is. People can try to skew or use the information in a negative way or worse still, we could be interpretting the information wrong or the machines could be telling us the wrong picture like with improper clustering. The good news is that there are alot of people who are aware of the limitations of these methodologies and we just have to keep improving them and building on these solutions.  

## Reflection on exercises:

Activities for this week:  
For the two exercises done (that I might be basing my capstone exercise on), I will be doing it on the Topic Modelling Tool and Text Analysis with Overview   

### Topic Modelling Tool  
Overall, I found this tool to be incredibly simple and potentially powerful. I was able to get the example working in under a minute of setup (barring a bit of misreading on my end) and it was able to collate the information so efficiently. In the future, I hope to feed it more substantive data but it looks promising for the capstone exercise.  

### Text Analysis with Overview  
Yet another great tool! It was also very easy to use as all I had to do was upload the file and the tool did the rest of the work. It had a pretty intuitive interface so I played around with the different options like the entities and search but the blog alluded that there is a bit more to it that I'll have to investigate further. I think in conjunction, they would make great additions for the capstone exercise to analyze the data from different perspectives and modelling methodologies.  

## Connections between readings and exercises
The connections between the readings and exercises were a little all over the place, but it makes sense since this particular module is covering quite a lot of material and the exercises were made to be a lot so we had the option to choose from a variety of tools and methods to analyze and approach our capstone exercise. One of the main connections I could relate and make was due to the topic modelling exercise I did and the annotation here (https://hyp.is/m4-YmosSEem5oTOQde6n6g/sappingattention.blogspot.com/2012/11/when-you-have-mallet-everything-looks.html). As it happens, if the tool itself clusters the data improperly, you could get a false notion of how the information is structured. I don't think this happened in particular with the information I was provided with but its good to keep in mind. I think the topics that were made were a little nonsensical and possibly my fault since I could have changed the parameters a bit so that it was more specific; in the end, another major connection is that the tool is only as powerful as the person who uses it and interprets the data from it.
