# Week 5 Reflections:

## Reflection on readings: 

Questions to reflect on:  
What would your last essay last term have looked like, if you'd been thinking along these lines?  
- The last history class/term I took was ancient civilization and it was a lot of reading and quizzing rather than essays. However, if I were to apply this situation to something where I did need data, I would think that it would make things much much simplier and easy to draw conclusions. The best thing would be that it is also solid evidence of how the data is interpretted in terms of visualization, in terms of retrieval and making sense of it all.  
What could history be like if more of our materials went through these mills?  
- History would be more quantative and analysis based rather than conjecture. That being said, as one of the articles pointed out, the data retrieved and analyzed by these methods and tools aren't perfect; they just make it easier and help us see things through another lens. It would definitely be a shift in how things are done and gathered and I think overall a good thing if the tools are further refined and the information gotten from them is not the end all conclusions.  
Ask yourself: who benefits from this? Who is hurt from this? Make an entry in your blog on this theme.  
- I think in general everyone would benefit from this as long as they do not take it at face value all thge time. Corpus linguistics that are able to find patterns and deal with a much larger volume of information and analysis than people can handle. The people who could be hurt from this is us; as it is already prevalent in the internet, there is fake data and information everywhere and that could hurt us who might take the information for what it is. People can try to skew or use the information in a negative way or worse still, we could be interpretting the information wrong or the machines could be telling us the wrong picture like with improper clustering. The good news is that there are alot of people who are aware of the limitations of these methodologies and we just have to keep improving them and building on these solutions.  


## Reflection on exercises:

Activities for this week:  
Importing, querying, and visualizing networks with Gephi <- igraph, R  
Topic modeling with the GUI topic modeling tool, and MALLET at the command line, and in R  
Simple maps with CartoDB (which may include georectifying and displaying historical maps as base layers)  
Corpus linguistics with AntConc  
TF-IDF with Overview  
Quick visualizations using RAW, an open source data visualization framework
