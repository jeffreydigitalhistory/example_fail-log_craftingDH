# Week 2 Reflections:

## Reflection on readings: 

---
How are these scholars portraying themselves?
How do they approach the idea of 'openness'?
How is your own work 'generous'?
---

The scholars themselves are portraying themselves in a fairly open manner; freely giving their contact information for diaglogue and other inquiries. They all have blogs, extensively listing their opinions on various topics, including open source related materials. Lastly, they are all for the idea of digital history, in which they see the medium as an overwhelming positive manner for distritbution and collaboration between people and ideas. 

They also approach the idea of opennesss in various ways. For example, Trevor Owens was a part of the Zotero project which something that has the ability to create smart bibliographies and facilitate transparency for primary sources in historical articles.

My own work is generous I suppose since its public in a sense (I do developer work). It's not minified in any way so if people were curious about how something that we develop is implemented, you can find it in the source code of that page. However, this is a layered way of seeing it and not particularly open. I hope in the future and for my job, we can integrate things such as Github into our processes so that our work can be built upon and reused by others!

Then, make an entry on your blog that contrasts this picture of 'open access research' with what you may have learned about doing history in your other courses. Where are the dangers and where are the opportunities? What does 'open access' mean for you as a student?
---

I haven't taken many history courses at the university level yet but there was one on ancient history that mgiht be comparable. From this stance, it's hard to gauge how open access research will be accepted since I think in terms of ancient history, a lot of how things that were done seem to be set in stone. That being said, I think those kinds of interpretations and how people used things and did things should and can be done iteratively - as sharing those ideas and concepts can lead to new ways of seeing how they did things.

The potential dangers of doing it this way in my opinion is a flooding of ideas and possibly copyright. If you have anyone have the ability to see your notes and research, it can lead to a flood of what should or shouldn't be interpretted from a certain stance for example. In addition, people can reuse your ideas which may be disheartening to not get credit for work that you have done in that field. I think both of these points in the grand scheme of things are minor but can be particularly damning when it comes to adopting more open source research. They can also be solved if there is a way of controlling what ideas get accepted and integrated (much like how forking and pull requests work in Github) and by giving proper credit to the predecessors of research (which may already be done widely)

In terms of opportunities, I think the sky is the limit. The amount of potential collaboration from a digital scale could be staggering as it allows people from various backgrounds and locations to work together versus being limited by a physical location. I also think that version control in a sense can show other researchers and historians how people came up with certain methodologies and research (much like what was mentioned in one of the readings) which could be incredibly helpful to triage how things get done.

Open access for a student means a lot since it can help us explore topics more easily. I think students, especially now and in the future, are more in tune with the digital environment and thus giving open access will allow them to go through records and learn from the more experienced historians on methologies and what to do. Therefore, it's incredibly exciting from the perspective of a student if this gets adopted more widely and the proper tools are in place for people to use it    

## Reflection on exercises:

Activities done:
Writing in Markdown
Using the DH Box command line
Converting files with the command line
Setting up GitHub
Interacting with GitHub from the command line

Markdown:
I found myself struggling more on how to find websites and images related to the post that I thought was interesting. For a discussion topic that could possibly have a niche point and argument, I struggled a bit to find relevant things to it. At some point I considered changing my annotations to talk about so that it would be easier to find something but I thought that would be disingenuous. 

Command Line:
As mentioned in my faillog, I'm fairly familair with Linux commands so a lot of this was a refresher for me. I did like how we use Nano since I usually use Vim for my command line text editing so that was a new thing that I got to learn!

Github:
Alot of this was a refresher for me since I've used Github quite a bit but there was a couple things here and there that was useful to know (I've noted them in my faillog).

Overall, I found it a very interesting week! I really liked the power of the DHBox as it functions essentially like a virtual linux box with the command line but with a nice gui (and doesnt take up as much ram as a vm would - or at least it doesnt seem like it!). Will likely look into it more for future use outside the course
