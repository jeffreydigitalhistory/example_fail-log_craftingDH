# Week 4 Reflections:

## Reflection on readings: 

On your blog, reflect on any data cleaning you've had to do in other classes.  

Why don't historians discuss this kind of work?  
What gets hidden, what gets lost, how is the ultimate argument weaker as a result?  
Or does it matter? Make reference (or link to) key annotations, whether by you or one of your peers, to support your points.
