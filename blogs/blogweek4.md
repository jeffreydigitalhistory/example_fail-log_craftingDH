# Week 4 Reflections:

## Reflection on readings: 

On your blog, reflect on any data cleaning you've had to do in other classes.  

Why don't historians discuss this kind of work?  
I'm guessing the reason this isnt discussed due to the likely "boring" implications of cleaning data. Maybe it is undervalued by their peers or by outside parties but it's a very important part of the research aspect. Data is a huge piece of the puzzle and making sure its clean (or as clean as possible) is a critical step to uncovering and making sense of it. The statement that the professor says where cleaning data is "80%" of it really hit home with me and shows the underlying vitality of this part of the job.  
What gets hidden, what gets lost, how is the ultimate argument weaker as a result?  
Or does it matter? Make reference (or link to) key annotations, whether by you or one of your peers, to support your points.  
In terms of what gets hidden or lost is ultimately how messy the data comes from the source and what sense we can make of it. We can have powerful tools such as OCR technology to try and transcribe information for us but in some cases, it's illegible or nonsensical. The overall argument may then lose validity if the source text is nonlegible or contradictory to what we think it is. Something that one of my peers talked about (https://hyp.is/oGRhzmReEeiTOd9s_OpmWQ/web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=93) but I didn't expand upon due to the fact that I would just be saying "yes I agree" si the importance of digitization and OCR technology into a format that is digestable and usable by other. Unfortunately, like what the article talks about with newspaper and the link, that information is not transferrable in the modern context and the digitization of these materials is needed. Therefore, as OCR technology becomes more and more sophisticated, we worry less and less about what gets hidden or lost and it becomes increasingly more clear and useful for others. In its current form, it's almost useless to try and peruse so much information unless its mass transcribed through machine programs and the like.  

## Reflection on exercises:

Activities for this week:    
- Regular expressions  
Found this to be a familiar, and yet somewhat challenging exercise! Familiar because I've dealt with it before but challenging because of the transformations/queries that we had to make. That being said, still enjoyed it and am curious to see how we can continue to utilize regular expressions in other forms of data cleaning!  
- Open Refine 
I mentioned this in the fail log but found Open Refine to be useful and practical, even outside of digital history and can maybe be used in work situations where we have messy or inconsistent data from manual input or other forms of consolidation. I can think of at least one project where we had similar words being used for various items that needed to be the same and this would have been a great way to cluster and group them together!  

## Connections from readings to exercises  
I think the readings emphasize the amount of work and effort it takes to deal with varying forms of data and organization of data (such as the XML) and is highlighting the messiness that it can come in. Especially considering that a lot of data isn't categorically organized in a way that is easy for people to reuse, using things such as regular expressions and Open Refine help consolidate the information into something useful for us. I liked in particular how they were used in conjunction, and that digitized documents from Google can be transformed into a nice and universally known format like csv is honestly quite amazing to me!
