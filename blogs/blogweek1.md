## Week 1 Reflections:

# About me:

I'm in this class frankly because I needed another credit to graduate and it sounded interesting in comparison to the other ones offered online. Even though it is a flimsy reason, I find that currently, I am enthuasistic based off of the course structure and content and I feel like I will learn a lot and be interested from start to finish as I currently am. I like how the course is laid out, the emphasis on self learning, the use of technology to interact with other students and the progressive thinking of the professor which is all like a fresh blast of wind after a lot of somewhat "standard" courses. 

My level of comfort with digital technology is fairly high since I am a computer science student and have always been pretty good with figuring out how to work things out, whether at the hardware or software level. That being said, I, like everyone else, can struggle when the instructions are unclear or there are the inevitable "unexplainable" tech issues that arise so I am still wary when it comes to using the new tools that are being introduced in the class.

The kinds of history that I'm interested in vary quite largely; I've been interested in seeing history from a cosmic point of view (origins of the universe/earth), from the point of view of the animal kingdom (how animals originate, dinosaurs, sharks, etc) and anthropology ranging from history of old civilizations to political issues in the last couple decades. I'm curious to see about what kinds of things we'll be focusing on in the course and what else I can learn!

Ultimately what I hope to get out of this course is to learn something new. I'm fairly familiar with some of the concepts being introduced (such as big data, visualization of data, etc) so I'm curious as to how we are to execute and exercise digital history in the context of these things!

# What was done:

Over the past week, what has been done is all set up for the course in terms of tools and such. The first of which is Hypothesis which is a platform to annotate pages for notes but also as a forum to interact with other students. The second is Github which is what we are using at the moment as a way to share our submissions and the last is DHBox which is a tool I am not fully aware of its capacity of yet since all we did was create our instance.

In terms of the readings, I've noticed a lot of talk regarding big data and its ever increasing presence for laypeople and disseminating information. They mostly talked about the impacts, visualization of data, and tools that can help aggregate this data. All interesting stuff so far and I'm curious as to how we will integrate this information in the coming weeks!
