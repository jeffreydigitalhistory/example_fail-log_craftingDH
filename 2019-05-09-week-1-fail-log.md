# Week 1 fail log

I had a fairly good first week. I am familiar with Github (via school and work) and although DH Box and Hypothesis are both new, I've found that they are interesting tools that I'm getting used to and learning to appreciate. That being said, I did some some concerns and stumbled a bit in relation to the location of things and the DHBox.

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/rQCNHHQhEem2oVMfUTVNIw/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/capstone-exercise-1.html) highlights my concern over the final capstone project that we will have to submit. Being someone who only has last took history in grade 10 (the mandatory Canadian history course), my familiarlities with the "right" way to extend or develop history based projects is a bit intimidating. That being said, as I mentioned in the annotation, this is also an exciting and intriguing part as I am looking forward to the challenge at the same time!

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/KdQbQnQiEemODOeXEnRdqA/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/rubric-and-assessment.html) is more of a quality of life issue than anything. I sometimes work between two computers (my work computer during my lunch/free time and my home computer) and find that I am constantly trying to track down the workbook file. For the first couple days, likely due to my negligence, I thought only the manual was of importance to the course and disregarded more work to be deferred to later weeks since I could not find any other links. Then taking a look further the next day I found it - I wonder if more visibility of such an important piece would help other students who might find this confusing. In the meanwhile, I've bookmarked the page and hopefully that will help me navigate to it quicker and more effectively in the future.

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/m2JJUHQiEemPW8N9DiLasA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) is a bit of a absent minded thought on my end. I find that I try opening my DHBox to see if it's still working at times and thinking that its not working. After a couple minutes of trying and looking around, I realize that I need to be the on Carleton VPN when accessing it. This happened maybe twice so I'll try to be more cognizant of opening it in the future!

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, I've found the getting start and set up week to be good so far. Hopefully this trend continues to the next week when we actually do more work relevant to the course!
